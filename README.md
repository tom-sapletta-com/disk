## parted

install
```
apt install parted
```

prepare:
```bash
parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt
```

out:
```
Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/sdb will be destroyed and all data on this disk will be lost. Do you want to continue?
Yes/No? y                                                                 
Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.

### GPT with proxmox tool
+ [Backup Storage â€” Proxmox Backup 3.0.1-1 documentation](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/storage.html)

To initialize a disk with a new GPT, use the initialize subcommand:

```bash
proxmox-backup-manager disk initialize sdb
```


### Delete Partitions with parted

Before deleting a partition, back up your data. 
All data is automatically deleted when a partition is deleted.

+ run the **d** command in the fdisk command-line utility.

### Verify Partition Deletion

Reload the partition table to verify that the partition has been deleted. 

+ run the **p** command.

The terminal prints out the partition structure of the disk selected in Step 2.


### Save Changes and Quit

+ run the **w** command to write and save changes made to the disk.



## Formatting Disk Partition with ext4 File System

### Format a disk partition with the ext4 file system using the following command:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

### Next, verify the file system change using the command:

```bash
lsblk -f
```


## Check disk performance

```bash
hdparm -Ttv /dev/sdb1
```

out:
```
/dev/sdb1:
 multcount     =  0 (off)
 readonly      =  0 (off)
 readahead     = 131064 (on)
 geometry      = 60801/255/63, sectors = 976771087, start = 2048
 Timing cached reads:   12072 MB in  2.00 seconds = 6041.48 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1214 MB in  3.04 seconds = 398.73 MB/sec
```

SPEED: **398.73 MB/sec**
